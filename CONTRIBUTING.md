# CONTRIBUTING
> [!warning]
> While I'm choosing an appropriate license, please don't open PRs. I'm afraid this is "All Rights Reserved", which implies you'll have to sign an explicit agreement to give me all rights over your contribution (I don't want that). I want each contributor to be credited, but I also want to be credited.

- If you have any suggestions for rants, please let me know! (open issues ~~or PRs~~)
- Don't be afraid! I'll put your name next to your rant (if you don't care about anonymity)
- All rants about S are welcome, as long as they're facts
- Blindly insulting S is not allowed
- If you think I've made a mistake, or I'm telling lies, please open an issue to explain why
