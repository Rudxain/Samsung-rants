> NSFW!

## Intro

I was already bored/tired of using Samsung products (specially phones), but now I'm at my **absolute limit.**

## Backstory

All started when I was using my Galaxy J3 Mission, tinkering around, looking at the "Running processes" section of the dev settings.
Then, I notice that the launcher (Samsung Experience Home) was running **all the time** since the device was turned on (it matched "Up Time").
The culprit was the "notification listener service", which I couldn't turn off because it was **hidden from the "Notification Access" list.**
This was very annoying, because it constantly consumed RAM for no reason.

## Present

I was gifted a Galaxy A31, I was disappointed I got yet another Samsung phone (before the J3, I had a Sony Xperia Z5, and before that I got a Galaxy S4).
But I was very happy that I could finally use Android 12, and even happier because I finally have an **unlockable bootloader!**
(I was so unlucky that the Z5 was hard-locked, not even the official Sony codes helped me. The J3 was "even-harder-locked" because of Verizon's fault)

I was doing the same monitoring+tinkering process... when suddenly... **the Game Launcher was running** for no reason. I went to the details, and guess what...
**IT'S THE FUCKING NOTIFICATION LISTENER AGAIN! AND IT'S ALSO HIDDEN FROM THE NOTIFICATION ACCESS LIST!!!**

## Other stuff I hate

### SMS history
For some reason, Samsung thought it's a good idea to log SMSs in the Phone app, **even if "Show messages" is disabled.**
So if you want to save storage, or increase your privacy, you're forced to enable "Show messages" to delete them.
This is even worse when the vast majority of messages are useless carrier ads and reminders, now you're forced to delete those messages **ON BOTH APPS**.

This annoyance got even worse when they added the "Trash" feature to all their apps. Now you gotta delete it thrice!!! (unless you disable the Trash)

They haven't improved this, for years

### Recent files
Speaking of logging, "My Files" logs recently used files **even if the list is hidden**, meaning you also have to remember to clear it.

### Persistent clipboard

I installed Gboard, used it for some time, cleared its ðŸ“‹CB history, uninstalled it, and noticed S Keyboard **still has the old CB entries**.

This is a massive **privacy vulnerability!**
Imagine you thought you deleted all passwords from a 3rd-party CB, only to get hacked by someone who took your phone and enabled S Keyboard as the default keyboard.

They haven't fixed this for years! The J3 Mission has the exact same problem.

I don't think this is an "Android limitation", the system can easily detect when a different keyboard is being used, and avoid logging on the native CB.

### Automatic dictionary

S Keyboard automatically adds words to its dictionary, **all the time**, unlike Gboard, which doesn't collect data when using Chrome-incognito (perhaps S Keyboard does something similar with S Internet? IDK).

This means I have to clear **ALL PERSONALIZATION DATA**, everytime I use incognito mode.

Gboard has a dedicated menu to manage the dictionary.

Again, unsurprisingly, they haven't improved this for years. Come on, S, is it really difficult?

### Legacy Google dependency

[Another one](https://youtu.be/jEI3N9kIyP4), about the keyboard (3 strikes!!!).

You know that microphone button that converts speech to text? Turns out, it _depends on the Google app, not G Speech Services._

Since I uninstalled G, I realized the difference between "Voice Typing" and "Voice Typing [Legacy]", in the input settings. "Legacy" means "Google app".

Now, everytime I want to use voice input, I have to open the notification panel, and select "Google Voice Typing" (provided by Speech Services)

### Useless account
S forces users to use a Samsung Account, even for *looking at the list of app updates in Galaxy Store.*
So if you want to control auto-updates for individual apps, you gotta login to a useless S Account! Amazing, isn't it?! /s
That is just the tip of the iceberg, S forces you to use that account for lots of other unnecessary things!

### Bloatware
S has an obsession with making and pre-installing apps that Google already made.
As a minimalist person, this is absolutely disgusting:

- "So you like Google Assistant? How about you use Bixby instead?"
- "You still use G lens? How about you use Bixby Vision?"
- "G Tasks doesn't exist! Use Reminder!"
- "Don't use Google Autofill! Use S Pass"
- "Chrome is so 2016, use S Internet"
- "Gmail sucks, use S Mail"

Ok Samsung, how about you stop leeching off of Android, and make your own motherfucking operating system? (just like Huawei).

### Blue Light Filter

When I was looking at hidden app activities in my J3 Mission, I noticed S made its own "BLF" independent of AOSP's "Night Light",
but it was no-op, so I had to resort to the AOSP version (which was also hidden from Settings, for some reason).

Everytime I wanted to toggle NL, I had to use an Automate-flow that changed the setting. And if I wanted to configure the color temperature or schedule, I had to use Automate to open the hidden activity.

They literally updated my device from Android 7 to 8, and decided to hide a well-behaved fully-functional feature, just because they were working on a clone that doesn't even work on the lock-screen...

Thank you, Samsung, for being so annoying!

### Lockscreen banding

No matter the lightning conditions, no matter the brightness, the lockscreen wallpaper has a severely reduced bit-depth. So much that it causes big banding artifacts.

And don't tell me "Oh, that's just OLED being OLED", **no**, I already said it **always happens**.

IDK if this is an Android 12 thing, but I'm pretty sure it's Samsung's fault. I've never seen an Android have that inconsistency.

### Invalid MMI codes

I've never seen a Galaxy device properly respond to an MMI code.

You know, those numbers and symbols you have to dial in the Phone app to open hidden settings? [That's forbidden](https://tenor.com/view/we-dont-do-that-here-black-panther-tchalla-bruce-gif-16558003)

None of the AOSP codes, nor OEM-specific (Samsung), work. It doesn't matter if the device is old or new (from Galaxy J3 to A31)

### RIP SUIT
[No System UI Tuner?!](https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Fnewsfeed%2F002%2F297%2F368%2F17f.jpg)

### Memory "optimization"
Something I find pointless, and perhaps harmful, is Device Care app.
The battery optimization features are nice and all, *but why Memory?*
It doesn't "close background apps", it **deletes RAM-cache**, that's the *opposite* of device optimization.
Even worse, they added "Auto-Optimize", and it's **enabled by default,** meaning that every single day, your device **discards ALL of its RAM-cache**, only to generate it again.

Wait, it actually stops "background" apps!, but only those in the "recent apps" screen, which are the most frequently used apps!, therefore **reducing startup perfomance for apps that the user ACTUALLY USES**

This has been an issue **for years**, before One UI even existed.

### Persistent swap memory
Speaking of that, there's a "RAM Plus" feature that's set to **4GB by default**. This has several problems:

- the "Virtual RAM" is **always active**, unlike Linux's swap (which is only active when RAM explodes). this considerably reduces flash-storage lifespan, because of the frequent write-operations
- more background apps means more battery wasted
- storage is already slower than memory, and running too many BG apps will decrease performance

The good news is that "One UI 5" will allow users to easily turn it off. I have "One UI 4" so I had to [use ADB to disable it](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/disable-samsung-ram-plus.4491743).
To control it easily, I granted /Llamalab/Automate `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission. This also allows me to [enable it again](https://reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/zj7itl/comment/izw7y8q) (just-in-case)

## Conclusion

Needless to say, I fucking hate Samsung, **almost as much as Apple**. I wish I had a phone by any other brand (except Huawei and Xiaomi, those are useless to me)

S knows they have a monopoly over the smartphone market, and they love to abuse that power.
**S is following the steps of YouTube**

To be fair, S is a good hardware designer/manufacturer, I just think they suck at software design.
BTW, I think this is the reason why Google and S complement each other, because G sucks at hardware.

I've never used a Galaxy Nexus, but I guess it was a high-quality phone for its time (for the reasons mentioned previously)
